################################## PROBLEM DEFINITION #############################################

This project focuses on the futuristic technology for supermarkets. As supermarkets are a critical
component of society introduction of new technology to improve accessibility, efficiency and the
customer experience on a large scale has the potential to make a significant impact.
Our team of six aims to the utilise the hardware, provided to us by the university of Sydney, to
improve the functionality of the self checkout booths at a supermarket. Currently, in
supermarkets, self checkout booths require an employee to direct flow of traffic. During busy
times, the queue to enter the self checkout area can become lengthy, in addition to this there can
be poor visibility at the front of the line to see which self checkout booths are occupied or vacant.

Our solution aims to increase the efficiency of foot-traffic at the self checkout booth by the
implementation of a automated instruction system to the customers. This is done using the Lidar
sensor to check vacancy of an individual booth, motors, gyroscope and magnetic field to gather
information on which booth is being checked. Further, the use of the LCD screen and speaker to
relay information to the customer at the front of the line as to which booth is free along with a
tune to grab their attention when a booth becomes available.
This project is broken into a multitude of different modules which are documented below. In
order to work as a team each member is allocated a selection of modules, documenting it as they
progress, to allow for easy integration and understanding of each others work.

################################## MODULES #############################################
Lidar Detection Module:

The final aim of this module is to be able to decide if a booth is occupied or vacant. The first
stage of this module is to detect an object using the lidar, whilst stationary. The presence of an
object is determined by the distance of the detection. This is decided by an initial reading of the
layout of booths when they are known to be all vacant. In order to test and eliminate noise for
these readings, testing and averaging multiple measurements and known/measured distances was
conducted.
The second component of this module is to incorporate object detection whilst the lidar is
moving. This has a sub-module which controls the motors of the system to rotate the lidar, along
with integration with the next module to keep track of the orientation, and hence update the
correct booth’s occupancy status. Peter is responsible for this module.

Orientation Module:

The final aim for this module is to provide an accurate and live position measurement for the
direction the lidar is facing. This can be done in a basic manner using the values we give to the
motors. However, in the interest of accuracy and ability to measure the orientation, if the motor
values aren’t accurate. Utilisation of the Gyroscope to firstly read data and correct for bias, along
with provide real time measurements for orientation. The primary role of this module is to be
responsible for providing information to all other dependant modules on what booth is currently
being pointed to. Hugh and Lincoln is responsible for this module.

Music Alerting Module:

The final aim for this module is to create a tone when a new booth goes from being occupied to
vacant. This serves to alert the customer at the front of the line that they can move to a vacant
booth. This module should work in conjunction and in a similar fashion to the LCD Screen
module, this is it’s primary function to be a user information module. Jimmy is responsible for
this module.

LCD Screen Module:

The final aim for this module is to display the number of free booths on the LCD screen, this
depends on the measurement of the gyro and lidar sensors as to which booth is being pointed to,
this will be sourced from the output of the orientation module. The input of this module is an
integer and the output displays that number booth and that it is free. This LCD display is
indicative of the proof of concept design for a small screen to direct the customer at the front of
the line as to where to go if a booth is free. Orgil is responsible for this module.


PC Display Module:

The final aim for the PC display module is to convey the occupancy status information externally,
outside of the board to a PC. To be able to display on a larger monitor screen. This would
increase the functionality of information to be received by the customers, possibly those who are
further back in the line waiting, giving them an estimate of the turnover of booths and occupancy
status. The data given to the external PC could also be analysed to perform estimated wait times
for customers and could become quite extensive. The implementation of this module would be an
add on to basic functionality, and hence the completion of the base modules are prioritised.
Linxi is responsible for this module.
