Meeting date/time: 3rd May 2022, 02:00 PM
Location: Discord/lab

Present: 
  Hugh, Peter, Linclon, Jimmy, Orgil, Linxi

Meeting Purpose: 
  Finalise our idea and make a start on coding different modules

Activities:
  1. Talk to tutor about idea, 	
  2. Brainstorm ideas for major project
  3. Create a list of modules for our idea
  
  Activities throughout the week:
  Peter - Take hardware, do lidar testing
        - Stationary Lidar module, 100% complete, best way to get a good results (possible averages)
        - Rotate lidar
        - Export Lidar data
  
  Linclon:
    - Gyroscope values
    - Functions to integrate data
    
   Hugh:
    - Gyroscope module, comparing with stepper motor values
    - Set the base code for our project
    
    Jimmy:
      - Music module, based on a variable play a tone
          - Keep module as easy to change as possible for when we get sample data
     
    Orgil:
      - Displaying which number booth is free on the LCD, based on variable
        - Keep module as easy to change as possible for when we get sample data
     
     Linxi
     - Work with Orgil on LCD display
     - Possibly research communication with computer to create a user interface on PC
     
  
  
Future Plans:
  Check how everyone progressed
  Set of lidar and gyroscope data values for everyone to being coding based on this
